Emogic Tarot Reading plugin for Wordpress

== Description ==

A Tarot Reading plugin for Wordpress

For casual users:
Easily add a Tarot reader to your wordpress site.
We provide 2 databases, use the standard Rider-Waite deck images, and a few spreads.

For advanced users:

You will find this is the most flexible Tarot plugin.
It was designed for those who are serious about making their own readings, databases, and using their own images.
You can edit everything using the wordpress editor and shortcodes.
It can easily be used for other types of readings. Rune readings for example.
You just need some Rune graphics and a Rune database.
Flexibility comes with a price and that price is a moderate learning curve.
To make your own spreads you should have a working knowledge of Wordpress Shortcodes.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is very helpful.

If anyone would like to donate databases or graphics that you have created, I would consider adding it to this plugin.

== Installation ==

On activation:

169 images will be copied from this plugin to the wordpress "uploads/Emogic-Images" folder.
These images will be imported to the wordpress media gallery.
All the files under this plugin's "/pages" folder will be imported as wordpress pages.
The pages will be created in a quasi folder structure (parent/child) and will mirror the plugin "/pages" folder structure.
Your main tarot page will be: Emogic Tarot or ?pagename=Emogic-Tarot
You can rename this page.

Important:

If you deactivate this plugin tarot pages, databases, and images installed by this plugin will be deleted. Before disabling this script, make copies or backups if you want to save any changes you have made.
