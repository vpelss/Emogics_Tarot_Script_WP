Emogic Tarot Reading plugin for Wordpress

== Description ==
Emogic Tarot Reading plugin for Wordpress

This plugin is for those who are serious about making their own spreads, reading text, and use their own images. We provide 2 databases, use the standard Rider-Waite deck images, and a few spreads.

You can create your own spreads and databases. Use any images. It can easily be used for other readings. Rune readings? You just need some graphics and a database. If anyone wants to donate a database or graphics you created, to this project I will consider adding it to the plugin.

== Installation ==
Place this directory under your Wordpress wp-content\\plugins folder

Activate it

Your main tarot page will be: Emogic Tarot ?pagename=Emogic-Tarot You can rename the page.

Important: If you uninstall the plugin your tarot pages and databases will be deleted. If you edited the original plugin files, make copies or backup if you want to save any changes you have made. There are many good plugins to backup your site
